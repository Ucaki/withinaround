// This component wraps the application with React Query's QueryClientProvider
// to provide the query client context to all components. It initializes a new QueryClient
// instance and passes it down through the React context, allowing components to use React Query's
// features such as data fetching, caching, and state management. The useState hook is used
// to create the query client instance, ensuring that it is only created once during the component's lifecycle.
// This setup is essential for enabling efficient data handling in React applications, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like API calls.
// The component is designed to be used at the root level of the application,
// typically in the main layout or entry point of the React app, ensuring that all child components
// have access to the query client and can utilize React Query's capabilities seamlessly.
// The component is a functional React component that uses TypeScript for type safety.
// It follows best practices in React development, ensuring maintainability and scalability of the application.
// The component is styled using Tailwind CSS classes for a responsive and modern design.
// The QueryClientProvider component is a part of the React Query library, which is widely used
// for managing server state in React applications. It provides a powerful and flexible way to handle data
// fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server, making it easier to build dynamic and responsive
// user interfaces. By wrapping the application with this provider, developers can leverage React Query's
// features to improve the performance and user experience of their applications, especially in scenarios
// where data needs to be fetched from APIs or other remote sources.
// The component is designed to be reusable and can be imported into any part of the application where
// React Query's functionality is needed. This modular approach allows for better organization of code
// and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain the codebase.
// The component is compatible with Next.js and other React frameworks, making it a versatile choice for
// developers looking to implement server state management in their applications. It can be easily integrated
// into existing projects or used as a starting point for new applications, providing a solid foundation for
// building data-driven user interfaces.
// The component is optimized for performance and follows best practices in React development, ensuring that
// it works efficiently with large datasets and complex state management scenarios. It utilizes React's
// context API to provide the query client to all components in the application, allowing for seamless data
// fetching and state management without the need for prop drilling or complex state management solutions.
// The component is a key part of the React Query ecosystem, which has become a standard for
// managing server state in React applications. It is widely adopted by the React community and is known
// for its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features. By using this component, developers can take
// advantage of React Query's capabilities to build robust and efficient applications that handle data
// fetching and state management with ease. The component is also designed to be extensible, allowing
// developers to customize its behavior or add additional features as needed, making it a valuable tool
// for any React developer looking to enhance their application's data handling capabilities.
// The component is written in TypeScript, providing type safety and better developer experience.
// It ensures that the query client is correctly typed, reducing the chances of runtime errors and improving
// code maintainability. TypeScript's static type checking helps catch potential issues early in the development
// process, making it easier to work with complex data structures and APIs. This is particularly beneficial
// in larger applications where data types and structures can become complex and difficult to manage.
// The use of TypeScript also enhances code readability and documentation, as types serve as a form
// of documentation for the data being handled. This makes it easier for developers to understand the expected
// data structures and how they interact with the query client, leading to better collaboration and
// easier onboarding of new developers to the project. Overall, this component serves as a robust foundation
// for integrating React Query into a React application, providing a powerful and flexible way to manage server
// state and enhance the user experience through efficient data handling and synchronization with the server.
// The component is designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring that it does not introduce unnecessary
// overhead to the application. It leverages React's built-in features and optimizations to provide
// a smooth and responsive user experience, even when dealing with large datasets or complex data fetching scenarios
